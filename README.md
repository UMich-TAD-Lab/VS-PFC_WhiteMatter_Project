These are the files needed for the analysis of VS-PFC white matter connectivity and linking it with VS activation to social and monetary rewards. If you have questions regarding these analyses, email lcgayle@umich.edu. 

This diffusion MRI data was analyzed using the methods described in Goetschius et al., 2019, NeuroImage and Goetschius et al., 2020, Devlopmental Cognitive Neuroscience. The scripts used for analysis can be found here: https://github.com/lgoetschius/ProbabilisticTractography_On_Flux
